    <h1>Clustering Analysis</h1>
      <br/>
      <p>
          This notebook provides a guide to Clustering Analysis, an unsupervised learning tasks, where algorithms have to 
          automatically learn patterns from data by themselves as no target variables are defined beforehand.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          When a dataset does not provide a target variable the use of <b>Clustering Analysis Algorithms would uncover 
          natural 
          patterns by grouping similar data points.</b>

          Clustering Analysis Algorithms are well known and applied in the data science industry for grouping and 
          highlighting 
          similar data points, detecting outliers and showing known and unknown patterns in the dataset. Some of the common 
          uses of Clustering Analysis Algorithms are:
          <ul>
              <li>Fraud detection by identifying unusual clusters from the data.</li>
              <li>Uncover natural patterns by grouping similar data points.</li>
              <li>Prediction of new tendencies on natural individuals.</li>
          </ul>
